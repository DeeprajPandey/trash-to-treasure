## About
Trash to Treasure helps users in recycling waste by using geocaching! Using Google Maps on the user's device, they can find recycling spots and recycle their products/waste. By going to the specified spots and recycling, users can earn points. Once enough points have been earned they can then redeem their points into something useful!

## Motivation
Daily, an enormous amount of waste is generated from a household and into a region!! Yet there are very few solutions to such problems. Many solutions include just recycle the good from the waste and burn the rest. Many people don't even choose to recycle and thus these products end up in landfills. Thus, all this leads to pollution of different kinds like air, water, etc. Due to heavy amounts of waste generated every day, many people die! Therefore, our solution tries to solve these problems through digital means and hence the name **Trash to Treasure.**
