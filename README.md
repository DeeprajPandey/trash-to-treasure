## About
Trash to Treasure helps users in recycling waste by using geocaching! Using Google Maps on the user's device, they can find recycling spots and recycle their products/waste. By going to the specified spots and recycling, users can earn points. Once enough points have been earned they can then redeem their points into something useful!
